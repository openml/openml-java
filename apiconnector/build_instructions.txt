To compile using Maven (mvn): 

mvn -X clean release:clean release:prepare release:perform -Dusername=janvanrijn -Dpassword=...

To release on maven central, go to:

https://oss.sonatype.org/
(username: janvanrijn)

Basically, the following requirements need to be met:
* POM.xml requires a distributionManagement tag with servers
* Settings file requires username / password for all servers (~/.m2/settings.xml)
* GPG key should be available on the system (can be refered to in settings file)
* GPG key should be available on key server (e.g., using `gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --send-keys KEY_ID`)
can be checked with `gpg -vvvv --keyserver "keys.gnupg.net" --recv-keys "KEY_ID"`

A typical settings.xml file can look like this:

```
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>sonatype-nexus-staging</id>
      <username>janvanrijn</username>
      <password>HERE_THE_SONATYPE_PASSWORD</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>sonatype-nexus-staging</id>
      <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
      </activation>
      <properties>
        <gpg.executable>gpg2</gpg.executable>
        <gpg.passphrase>HERE_THE_GPG_PASSWORD</gpg.passphrase>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
</settings>
```

Known errors:

* JAVA_HOME needs to be set
Can find Java alternatives by running `sudo update-alternatives --config java`
Omit bin directory (e.g., `export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64`)

* command get_passphrase failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device
You should set yout GPG_TTY variable for it to work, as in [this document](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/Invoking-GPG_002dAGENT.html):

```
GPG_TTY=$(tty)
export GPG_TTY
```

* Command gpg2 not found (happened on a Macbook)

Ensure that gpg is installed (through brew)
Use source gpg to identify where it is located
Make a symlink, so that the command gpg2 points to the gpg binary, e.g.,
ln -s /usr/local/bin/gpg /usr/local/bin/gpg2
